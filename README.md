# Blacksmith-Game
A game about blacksmithing. Inspired by Blacksmith: Heat the Furnace on Scratch, by user 'happycatty': https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/305294101/

This is my very first actual project of any length and I am not by any means trying to make this at all 'polished', 'balanced', or 'well-coded'. If you have any non-constructive suggestions, complaints, or criticisms I invite you to keep them to yourself. If you have a legitimate helpful suggestion for bettering my coding skills, though, feel free.
Note that I am sticking to fairly simple Java techniques for the foreseeable future, hence the terminal-based gameplay.

Should you wish to play this horrible masterpiece of mine, please find a java downloadable file somewhere in this mess. I do not know what I'm doing with this website so deepest apologies to anyone who I offend with my decisions, as with to the families of anyone killed by witnessing my horrible excuse for Java code.

## How to Play:

When launching the game, input an array with the text speed(in milliseconds) that you would like to play with. If you're unfamiliar with how to do this in Java, simply put the number you want in curly braces {} to form an array literal. Make sure your number is a standard integer or it will be rejected. 

Answer the prompts with the number next to the selection of your choice. There is very little automatic correction so be exact, the game doesn't like it when you put in weird stuff.

The aim of the game is to make money by crafting and selling products. You start with 50 gold and 5 copper ore, which is enough to craft your first copper dagger and sell it for more gold. You must carefully choose how to spend your money so that the products you make will sell for enough to keep your profits up.

Be warned! It is possible to lose this game if you make poor economic decisions---or even just if you get unlucky, as the price of sold items has a bit of randomness to it.

Programmed entirely in Java using BlueJ

Notable features which I taught myself to make this: interfaces(don't think I used them for what you're supposed to), ArrayList, exception handling and throw statements
