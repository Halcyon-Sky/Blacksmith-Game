# Blacksmith-Game
A game about blacksmithing. Inspired by Blacksmith: Heat the Furnace on Scratch, by user 'happycatty': https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/305294101/

This is my very first actual project of any length and I am not by any means trying to make this at all 'polished', 'balanced', or 'well-coded'. If you have any non-constructive suggestions, complaints, or criticisms I invite you to screw off. If you have a legitimate helpful suggestion for bettering my coding skills, though, feel free.
Note that I am sticking to fairly simple Java techniques for the foreseeable future: I'm only doing this language because of CSA AP and I intend to start learning a more sensible language like C++ to further my future game design endeavours. Hence the terminal-based gameplay.

Should you wish to play this horrible masterpiece of mine, please find a java downloadable file somewhere in this mess. I do not know what I'm doing with this website so deepest apologies to anyone who I offend with my decisions, as with to the families of anyone killed by witnessing my horrible excuse for Java code.
